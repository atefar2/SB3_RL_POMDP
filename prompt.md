- I'm going to show you two different approaches and I'm going to explain their outputs in order for you to help me understand how to solve for a distinct issue when training these With these two different methods.


# Current Issue:
You can see in the use of the custom_td3.py  uses the standard TD3 actor loss, which focuses solely on maximizing the expected future reward (the Q-value) without this explicit smoothness constraint.
Which allows it to maximize returns by oscillating through actions. Where is the custom_td3_L2.py Uses the smoothnes constraint But suffers from being able to make decisive actions based on what it's learned from the reward to maximize returns. I don't think that this is purely because of the two different reward types Because I've tested both of them. 
Rather the action-smoothing regularizer appears to be preventing the agent from capturing profits effectively. While the agent correctly identifies profitable opportunities, it holds onto assets for too long, failing to sell at the most opportune moments. This is because the regularizer, which acts as a Lipschitz continuity prior or a temporal Jacobian penalty, penalizes the large, decisive allocation changes required to realize gains.
Essentially, there is a conflict: although the reward function is incentivizing these opportune trades, the policy is simultaneously constrained by the smoothing penalty, which limits its ability to make the large-scale allocation decisions needed to capitalize on them.



# Current Condition: 
In real-world control tasks — especially in portfolio optimization, robotics, or industrial control — the **raw reward** is not enough. You care also about *how the agent gets there*:

* Smooth transitions vs. spiky, jittery adjustments
* Robustness to noise vs. hyperreactivity
* Interpretability and trust vs. black-box twitching

This is the **reward vs regularization dialectic**.

This is where your idea comes in: **constrain the *action space geometry*** by penalizing wild changes in \$\pi(s)\$ over small transitions in \$s\$.

You impose a penalty on the *rate of change* of the policy:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{smooth}} = \lambda_{\text{smooth}} \cdot \mathbb{E}_{(s_t, s_{t+1})}\left[ \| \pi(s_{t+1}) - \pi(s_t) \|^2 \right]
$$

This serves as a **Lipschitz continuity prior** — you are saying:

> "I assume that the optimal action should not change drastically between two adjacent states."

In continuous control (like portfolio weight vectors), this does the job of **softly bounding the gradient of the policy over time**, without needing discrete action clipping.

## Strategic Reflections

* **λ\_smooth as a meta-control knob**: Treat this as a *meta-policy tuning parameter* to adjust the “temperature” of your policy's fluidity.

* **Relation to KL Regularization**: This is akin to **temporal KL divergence regularization**, a la PPO:

  $$
  \mathbb{E}_t \left[ D_{\text{KL}}(\pi_{\text{new}}(a|s_t) \,\|\, \pi_{\text{old}}(a|s_t)) \right]
  $$

  But instead of penalizing change in distribution over a fixed \$s\_t\$, you're penalizing change in action as \$s\$ changes over time — a **temporal Jacobian penalty** on the policy map.

* **Information geometry perspective**: You are penalizing *non-smooth embeddings* of the state manifold into the action manifold — enforcing that the policy lies in a *low-torsion subspace* of \$\mathbb{R}^d\$.



CONTEXT:

- There is custom_td3.py and custom_td3_L2.py.
[The main difference between these two is one is using a L2 regularization between states in order to reduce the spiky actions. The custom_td3_L2.py implementation achieves this by adding a smooth_loss term to the actor's loss function. This term penalizes the squared difference between the policy's actions at consecutive states (s_t and s_{t+1}), effectively encouraging the agent to make smaller, less drastic changes to its actions from one step to the next. In contrast, custom_td3.py uses the standard TD3 actor loss, which focuses solely on maximizing the expected future reward (the Q-value) without this explicit smoothness constraint.]

- There are two reward methods --reward-type TRANSACTION_COST and --reward-type STRUCTURED_CREDIT.
[The difference between these two is that TRANSACTION_COST uses a relatively simple reward based on the immediate one-step percentage change in portfolio value, plus a long_term_bonus that rewards growth over a longer lookback window. While it is named for transaction costs, the cost penalty itself is calculated for logging but appears to be commented out of the final reward signal.
On the other hand, STRUCTURED_CREDIT implements a more advanced credit assignment mechanism. Instead of looking at the one-step portfolio return, it evaluates the agent's performance over a longer window (e.g., 30 steps). It calculates the return of each individual asset over that window and multiplies that return by the average allocation the agent held for that asset. The final reward is the sum of these allocation-weighted returns, plus a penalty for downside volatility (similar to a Sortino ratio). This method is designed to directly reward the agent for the long-term consequences of its allocation decisions, teaching it to hold assets that appreciate over time, rather than just reacting to immediate, potentially noisy, price changes.]
